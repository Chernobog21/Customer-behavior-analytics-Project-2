# Customer behavior analytics (Project 2)

This is my second data analytics project, focused on analyzing customer behavior.
The following key metrics were calculated and visualized:
- Retention
- Churn
- LTV
- RFM

The following tools were used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV datasets

The dataset includes sales records with the following information:
Invoice, Stock Code, Description, Quantity, Invoice Date,
Price, Customer ID, Country.
The dataset was sourced from - [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci/data]

This project focused not only on data cleaning and processing, but also on understanding customer behavior patterns.
The goal was to explore how cohort analysis, LTV, and RFM segmentation can be applied in real-world business scenarios.
Compared to the first project, this one emphasizes the analytical aspect - interpreting data and linking metrics to business implications.
Together, both projects cover the essential skills for an entry-level data analyst.
